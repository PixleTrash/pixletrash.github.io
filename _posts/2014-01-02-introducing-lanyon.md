title: Introducing thk127
---

There is nothing much to say about THK besides that he was created upon the discovery of the internet.  Placed in the idea of an organized system with files, managemnet and logic.  Seperate, yet together.  THK held on to the very idea that data has to mean something.  Every breath, every button pressed.  It must mean something.

### Built on Photos

Digital Photographs come into my world.  This unquestionable perminant data.  Posted, Perminint, attention.  Someonone out there saw me.  Not for who I really was but the persona that I created.  Intentional and un-intentional contacts started ariving in my inbox.  Contact from strangers that actually wanted to know me.  People on the same planet with me that thought my ideas were worth someting.  My insignificant life has affected another.  Converations start, perisit and grow over time.  Knowledge gained and lost.  Hope for a friend and getting desprate people that want to fuck.
